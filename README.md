# CF_TABLEAU_Influenza
Analysis of the flu season in USA with Excel and Tableau


•	The project was motivated by the fact that the United States experiences flu seasons when more people than usual suffer from the illness. It required to examine differences in staffing needs across each of the individual states.
•	During this project about flu season in the United States, I had a chance to expand on Excel analytical functions and work on visualizations in Tableau Public.
•	The data about demography, flu deaths, flu shots, doctor’s visits, and test results were collected in 5 separate sets.
•	Sources of the data are Census Bureau and CDC.
•	Upon exploring the business requirement document, I learned to interpret the business requirements from a data perspective by translating them into questions that guided me through the analysis.
•	While designing a data research project, I constructed a project management plan and developed a hypothesis: the US states with more vulnerable populations most likely record higher flu deaths numbers, thus hospitals in those states need more staff to handle sick patients.
•	In this project, I worked mostly with Census and Flu Death sets. Using exploration techniques learned during the previous project, I profiled the data and checked them for accuracy and consistency. 
•	Since data was spread between two sets, I needed to map variables and perform many steps to transform the data. Then, I was able to integrate the sets and look for a correlation between selected variables. 
•	Finally, I learned how to turn my research hypothesis into a testable statistical hypothesis by creating the null hypothesis, calculating the significance level, and interpreting the p-value. In this study case, I rejected the null hypothesis and confirmed my research hypothesis.
•	The second part of the influenza project concentrated on visualizations of the results in Tableau. I created comparison, temporal, spatial, and textual charts. Since the scope of the project required looking for insights to prepare for the next season, I also generated a forecast. 
•	In Tableau’s dashboard, I produced a report with my findings along with recommendations and video-recorded the insights for the stakeholders.
